2. View page source: Right click anywhere > Inspect

3. In the **Inspect** menu, go to:
   'Sources' tab \>
   'Snippets' tab \>
   \+ New snippet \>

4. Paste the .js code into the snippet.

5. Save the snippet:
   eg. 
   On Windows: CTRL + S.
   On macOS: Command + S.

6. **Run the code**:
   eg.
   On Windows: Ctrl + Enter.
